review: "An interesting account of life of life climbing and guiding in Kenya"
---
I enjoyed most of this book, especially the earlier chapters about moving to and getting established in Kenya. I particularly enjoyed reading about Kenya during the 70s and 80s, as it seems so different to the country I got to know for 20 or so years from the late 90s onwards. I really didn't enjoy some of the anecdotes that really just reminded of the worst of the privilege that White Kenyan's enjoy. The last anecdote in the book left a particular bad taste and seemed totally pointless, and undermined the author's final chapter, cheapening the reflections of the final few pages of the book.
