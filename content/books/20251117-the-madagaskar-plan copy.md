Another bonkers romp with the characters from [The Afrika Reich]({{< relref "/books/20251023-the-afrika-reich.md">}}). Again, I enjoyed this, perhaps a little less than the first one, and having spent time in many of the places the book is set in probably helps. You've really got to read the first book to get the most out of this one, and I'd really love to read the third, but considering this was published in 2016 and there's no sign of the third one yet I'm guessing I might be disappointed. This is a shame as this one really set things up for a nice climax. Again, an enjoyable read that saw me through the end of the holiday, but it's not going to change your life.
