This is a tough book to read, the story as much as there is one is violent and uncompromising, and there is no narrative arc, just a series of similar repetitive events. I took this to be a reflection on the lives of the characters involved: simple, repetitive, actually quite boring for a lot of the time, and occasionally very violent. It's a window into a world that I knew nothing of, and the book does provide an insight into the hopes, fears and priorities of a group of people that I have little or nothing in common with. A good, but not an easy read.
