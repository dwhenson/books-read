review: "A poor man's version of Tinker, Tailor, Solider, Spy"
---
This is perfectly well written and nicely paced thriller, that borrows very, very heavily from John le Carre's masterpiece. Sadly, this book doesn't even come close to [Tinker, Tailor, Solider, Spy]({{< relref "books/20240221-tinker-tailor-soldier-spy.md" >}}), and mainly serves to emphaise the genius of John le Carre's writing. With a few words and short description of a particular trait or feature, John le Carre could create a connection with each of the suspect characters in Tinker, Tailor, Solider, Spy. With this book, I could barely tell one suspect from another, and had so little connection with them that the eventual unmasking of the mole was a total anticlimax. This is the third book the author has put out in three years, each steadily weaker than the one before â€“ perhaps it's time they slowed down a bit?
