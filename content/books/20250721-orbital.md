This is one of the best written books I've ever read. I cannot imagine having the skill to combine words in the way the author has that create such emotion in a fellow human. Never overstated, the whole book comes in at 136 pages, to me at least, this is writing at it's very best. Sure "nothing" happens, there's little to no character development, but that's not what this is about for me. One of the joys of reading is being able to take a peak into worlds that I will never enter and have a glimpse of what life and situations are like that I will never experience. This book achieves that in spades. I'm not sure I'll ever forget the feeling of vertigo I felt lying in my own bed reading about the space walk. I read the last paragraph of the book about three times. To me it is one of the most perfect endings to a book I've ever read. Absolutely brilliant.
