review: "An interesting account of a prolific thief's activities"
---
An interesting, well-written but not earth-shattering read, however I did enjoy it. I was interested in the character, and the way his passion for are overwhelmed and consumed him, pretty much destroying anything good he had in life. The decline from 'gentleman thief' to petty criminal fencing stolen goods on eBay was well presented and engaging. It is a shame that the author wasn't able to secure interviews with the other people at the heart of the story, as this would have given the book some extra dimensions and greater depth.
