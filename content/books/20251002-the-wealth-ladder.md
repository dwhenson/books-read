review: "A solid framework for thinking about wealth, and how strategies need to adapt to changing financial circumstances."
---
I had read a couple of articles the author had written online which resonated with me so I thought I'd check out his book. The book proides a solid framework for thinking about wealth accumulation and how strategies and thinking need to change along with the situation you find yourself if. I think I mostly intuitively understood most of the points already as this is something I've given quite a lot of thought to, but, it was nevertheless, still very useful to have things laid out so clearly. I focused on the advice for the stage I am at which made perfect sense, and has given me some good points to think about. Overall a useful book to have read.
