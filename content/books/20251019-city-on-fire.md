review: "A perfectly passable holiday read."

A pretty enjoyable, holiday page turner that didn't demand too much of me. It felt very much like things were being set up as the first part of the trilogy, and the main character is enjoyable to spend time with and a likeable anti-hero. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series, but this doesn't compare to the Cartel triology. That said, the story was gripping, the characters engaging, and the whole thing hung together well.
