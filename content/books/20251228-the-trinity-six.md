I'm not sure where this came from to end up on my kindle, but it was a nice way to round off the year's reading. I enjoyed the stories, and the colourful cast of characters, and the story was much better than I expected it to be. I was expecting something set in the 1950s, but the present day setting with a story that arched through the last 50 years worked really well. The locations worked well, and the descriptions really resonated with me and I very much felt I could see what places and people would look like in my mind's eye — I always enjoy it when a book does that. Not one to read again, but I would definitely read other things the author has written.
