I guess it's a credit to this book that I read it so quickly. I loved the way that it was written from the viewpoint of a Russian, and that it just set out things from their point of view without trying to justify actions or opinions. I loved the way the story slowly unravels and really enjoyed the story within a story conceit. This book made a nice complement to [Red Notice]({{< relref "books/20241128-red-notice.md" >}}) which is written very much from the persective of an outsider looking in. The books predictions on the future of dictatorships with technology as an enabler was particularly chilling, but what I appreciated most of all was the coldly calculating way in which the main character articulates the doctrine of Putinâ€™s Russia and argues time and time again how it not just differs from Western norms but is intrinsically better suited to the 21st Century.
