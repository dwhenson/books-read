I'm trying to focus more on books that I wouldn't naturally be drawn to reading this year. This was one of those on my list, but that I wasn't really interested in reading, and what a great place to start. The book is pretty hard going at the start, and seemed to jump around between seemingly relatively unconnected people and events, but as it starts to focus more on NASA and the history of the space shuttles it settles down and gets much more readable and engaging. The author did an amazing job of balancing the technical and personal side of the story, and again, as the cast of characters focused more towards the actual Challenger disaster and the people involved I felt much more engaged. Overall I really enjoyed this book, and the exploration of decision making processes, technical challenges and the chemistry of characters involved in the shuttle programme was really engaging and brilliantly written.
