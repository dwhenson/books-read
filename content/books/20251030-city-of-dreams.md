Despite clichés, Winslow is too good a writer to produce anything that is less than entertaining. This was a strange read, with a number of quite separate sections bundled into one book. It felt very much like a long set up for the third book (which I'm looking forward to reading). Some parts worked better than others, but the end felt rushed and a little unsatisfying. Again, just fine for a passing a flight and the bits between and around it, but not one of the author's best books.
