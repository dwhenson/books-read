review: "A comprehensive history of Israel's targeted assassinations that provides much needed context to current events."
---
This book is long, detailed and, to be honest, a bit repetitive, but maybe that's the point? I started reading it before the recent strikes on Iran, which included a large number of targeted assassintations that would surely form a new chapter in the seemingly never-ending saga of strike and counter strike. The book did help me understand some of the history surrounding Israel's activities, and understand a bit better that the country hadn't always been the dominant power in region that it appears to be at the moment. I can't say that I enjoyed it though, and I haven't made it too the end, but for now I'm leaving it aside as it is dense, long and detailed, and I think I've got most of what I will get out of this book for the time being.
