This was the first John le Carré I ever read. I got it out the library on a whim and I can remember staying up really late to finish it. It was enjoyable to read it again, and I just love John le Carré's writing, but I didn't enjoy it quite as much as I remembered, or some of his later books that I have read more recently. That said, it's still a masterpiece of writing and really enjoyable. John le Carré's ability to convey meaning and feeling with just a few words is truly remarkable.
