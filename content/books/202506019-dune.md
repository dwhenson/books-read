I did enjoy this, but I don't think I would have as much if I hadn't seen the film. In a strange way the book and the film work really well together. I love the visuals from the film, and the action scenes that are more developed, but I did feel a little lost at times as things moved very quickly, with some important points hinted at rather than explained. The book does do a better job of explaining some of these points, but in a strange way also moves very quickly over time periods and key events, which I felt was a shame as I would have liked more time to explore the world and the characters better. I went back and watched the recent films again and enjoyed them much more having read the book. I'm not sure I'll be reading any others in the series though.
