Honestly, this book is kind of bonkers but I really, really enjoyed it. I guess having spent a large amount of my life if Africa helps. While the characters are just fine and likeable, if a little indestructible, the story races along from the outset and doesn't really slow down right throughout the book. That said, every German we meet is some kind of fanatical manic Nazi, which feels a little simplistic and lazy. But I did like the fact that while the story itself is pretty straight-forward the context and setting has been well thought out and isn't spoon fed to the reader, but slowly emerges. This really helps elevate things from a decent thriller to an really engaging read.
